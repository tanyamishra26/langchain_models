# LangChain Models

This repository documents my learning journey with **LangChain models**, focusing on understanding **how to use both open-source and closed-source models in Generative AI workflows**.

## 📁 Project Structure
- **1.LLM** – Experiments with base LLMs (API-based and local)
- **2.ChatModels** – Learning how to work with chat-based models using LangChain
- **3.EmbeddingModels** – Learning how to generate embeddings for semantic search and RAG use cases

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- LangChain
- Hugging Face (open-source & hosted models)
- OpenAI (closed-source models)
- Anthropic
- Gemini

## 🎯 Key Learning
Through this repository, I learned **how to use LangChain to work with both open-source and closed-source models**, including LLMs, chat models, and embedding models, and how to integrate them into real-world Generative AI applications.
